Chess Queens: Conquering the 8x8 Realm
Can you strategically place 10 queens on a chessboard so no two queens can attack each other (diagonally, horizontally, or vertically)? Buckle up, because this classic puzzle will test your problem-solving prowess!

The Challenge

Imagine a glorious 8x8 chessboard. Your objective is to deploy 10 queens on the board, ensuring none of these majestic rulers can capture each other. Remember, queens are ruthless - their attacks reach across rows, columns, and diagonals!

Conquering the Board

There are many ways to solve this puzzle. This repository is your war room, where you can code your own solution in your favorite language. Will you use a backtracking algorithm to explore all possibilities? Or perhaps a more mathematical approach tickles your fancy?

## ️ About

> The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that you'll be allowed to use in all your other projects.

For detailed information, refer to the [**subject of this project**](link to project details).

 TLDR: this project consists of coding basic C functions (see below), which are then compiled into a library for use in other projects of yours.

### Functions

This library includes functions from various standard C libraries:

* `<ctype.h>`
* `<stdlib.h>`
* `<strings.h>`
* `<math.h>` (optional)

**and non-standard functions for added functionality.**

A detailed list of implemented functions will be added soon. 

##  Index

`@root`

* [** libft:**](libft/) Your updated source code for the library.
* ** submX folder(s):** (Optional) Folders containing your submitted code to the project (including successes and failures).
* [** testing:**](testing/) (Optional) Your own testing programs for the library.

## ️ Usage

### Requirements

The library is written in C and requires the following to run:

* **`gcc` compiler**
* Standard C libraries

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the library:**

```bash
$ cd path/to/libft && make
